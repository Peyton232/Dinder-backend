A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub, and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.
I also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,
without being too specific. In the worst case, you can use this as a learning guide for your projects,
if for example you are only interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.


## IBM Bluemix Cloud Platform

**NOTE** *At this point it appears that Bluemix's free tier to host NodeJS apps is limited to 30 days.  If you are looking for a free tier service to host your app, Heroku might be a better choice at this point*

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=%2Fdashboard%2Fapps) for Bluemix, or use an existing account.

1. Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) to push your applications to Bluemix.

1. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the root of your application.
  ```
  applications:
  - name:      <your-app-name>
    host:      <your-app-host>
    memory:    128M
    services:
    - myMongo-db-name
  ```

  The host you use will determinate your application URL initially, e.g. `<host>.mybluemix.net`.
  The service name 'myMongo-db-name' is a declaration of your MongoDB service.  If you are using other services like Watson for example, then you would declare them the same way.

1. Connect and login to Bluemix via the Cloud-foundry CLI
  ```
  $ cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  ```

1. Create a [MongoDB service](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/MongoDB/index.html#MongoDB)
  ```
  $ cf create-service mongodb 100 [your-service-name]
  ```
  **Note:** this is a free and experiment verion of MongoDB instance.
  Use the MongoDB by Compose instance for production applications:
  ```
  $ cf create-service compose-for-mongodb Standard [your-service-name]'
  ```


1. Push the application

    ```
    $ cf push
    ```
    ```
    $ cf env <your-app-name >
    (To view the *environment variables* created for your application)

    ```

**Done**, now go to the staging domain (`<host>.mybluemix.net`) and see your app running.

### IBM Watson
Be sure to check out the full list of Watson services to forwarder enhance your application functionality with a little effort. Watson services are easy to get going; it is simply a RESTful API call. Here is an example of a [Watson Toner Analyzer](https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/) to understand the emotional context of a piece of text that you send to Watson.
